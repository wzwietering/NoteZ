Open = Opens a new file. The opened file must be a text file.
Save = Save the file. When the filename is known, the program will not ask for a filename.
Save as = Save the file using the file manager of the operating system. You can choose a name and directory.
Find = Search the text for a certain word. You can use regular expressions by checking the regex box.
Statistics = Shows information about the file. The diversity is the amount of unique words divided by the amount of words. The topics of the text are determined using the LDA model. The languages which can be detected are:  Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Kazakh, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish. The sentiment matches all words against a positive and a negative word list. The percentage is calculated by taking the highest of the positive and the negative word count divided by the total amount of sentiment words. Sentiment can only be analysed of English and Dutch texts. The percentage is corrected for the size difference of the positive and negative word data sets.
Character plot = The character plot shows the count per character.
Word plot = The word plot is a graph of the unique word count. Word plots do not include stop words and do lemmatize words. When you want to analyze all words, you can use the settings menu to include the filtered words.
Dispersion plot = The dispersion plot shows where certain words occur in the text. You can add multiple words by seperating them by commas.
Settings = Stop words are common words which do not add much information to the text, like 'the', 'and' and 'is'. Numbers are also filtered. Lemmatize words change words to the dictionary form. This is used to reduce the idea of diversity. 'walk', 'walks', 'walked' and 'walking' mean the same, but they appear as four unique words. By lemmatizing them they are all changed to 'walk'.
